#CHEATSHEET PYTHON 2: CONTROL FLOW

##Functions 

Function  |  Description  | Example
----------|---------------|--------
`range()` | makes a list of a certain range of numbers | `range(0,20)` makes a list from 0 to 19, 20 numbers where the first is inclusive and the last is exclusive <br> `range(0,20,2)` makes the same list but counts by 2
`input()` | asks the user for input, stores as variable | `x=input("Enter a phrase: ")` saves what user inputs as variable x


##Modules 

Module  |  Description  | Example
----------|---------------|--------
`random` | random number generator | `random.random()` picks a value between 0 and 1 <br> `random.randint(0,10)` randomly picks a value between 0 and 10
`time` | anything to do with timing | `time.asctime( time.localtime(time.time()) )` prints current date and time

##FOR is for iterating over values in a list, string, file, range, etc
{% highlight python %}												
for item in thing:
	do this command
	do that command
	#return to for statement and move to next item
{% endhighlight %}

Example: print 20 numbers (actually prints 0 to 19)
{% highlight python %}
for i in range(20):
	print i 
{% endhighlight %}

##IF is the basic decision making tool
{% highlight python %}
if logical condition == True: #line leading to an indented block ends with a colon
	do this command  #indenting blocks of code indicates how the program flows
	do this command
{% endhighlight %}

Example: check to see if a certain sequence is within a sequence
{% highlight python %}
sequence='AGGGTGTGTCCTGA'
if 'AGG' in sequence:
	print 'I found your sequence'
{% endhighlight %}
<br><br>
##IF ELSE is used for decision making in an either or context
```
if logical condition == True: 
	do this command  
	do this command
else:
	do this command
```

Example: Test whether sequence is RNA or DNA by seeing if there is a uracil
{% highlight python %}
seqs=['AUUGACAUCGAUCGA','AGACTGATCGATCTAG']
for seq in seqs:
	if 'U' in seq:
		print '%s is RNA' %seq
	else:
		print '%s is DNA' %seq
{% endhighlight %}

<br><br>
##IF ELIF is useful when you have more than one condition to check before deciding
{% highlight python %}
if logical condition == True: 
	do this command  
	do this command
elif other logical condition == True:
	do this command
else:
	do this command
{% endhighlight %}

Example: take the above step one step further
{% highlight python %}
seqs=['AUUGACAUCGAUCGA','AGACTGATCGATCTAG','JIEONONE']
for seq in seqs:
	if 'U' in seq:
		print '%s is RNA' %seq
	elif 'T' in seq:
		print '%s is DNA' %seq
	else:
		print '%s might be a protein' %seq
{% endhighlight %}

<br><br>
##WHILE is useful for checking input types, and when your value in the conditional might change within the loop
{% highlight python %}
while condition == True:
	do this command
	do that command
{% endhighlight %}

Example: check whether user input fits a certain criterion

{% highlight python %}
x=int(input("Give me a number from 1 to 10: ")) #accepts user input, converts to an integer
while x not in range(0,11): #if input was not number between 1 and 10
        print "That's not a number between 1 and 10 :(" #prints a complaint
        x=int(input("Give me a number from 1 to 10: ")) #asks for a new number
print "Thanks!" #thanks the user for being a nice user
{% endhighlight %}


<br><br>
##COMPREHENSIONS are faster than for loops and good to use when you're sifting through a long list or range

{% highlight python %}
list1=[] #make empty list
for item in thing:
	list1.append(item)	

list1 = [item for item in thing]
{% endhighlight %}

Example: make a list of 1 to 1000 cubed
{% highlight python %}
numbers=range(1000)
l=[x**3 for x in numbers]
{% endhighlight %}

<br><br>
##FOR LOOP IN BASH

{% highlight bash %}
for x in list; do command to variable x; done
{% endhighlight %}
Example: cat all fasta files in your current directory into a new file
{% highlight bash %}
for i in *.fasta; cat $i >> newseqs.fasta; done 
{% endhighlight %}
