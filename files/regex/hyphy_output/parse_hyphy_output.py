    Regular Expressions example script.
    
    All files name "rep..._nucfit.txt" in this directory are **real files from Stephanie's research**, produced by the software HyPhy (https://github.com/spond/hyphy). Each file, which is named according to the dataset it describes, contains information about a fitted model of sequence evolution.
    This script will parse all .txt files in the working directory to obtain the nucleotide mutation rate for "AC" (A to C or C to A), which appears in each file like this:
        global AC=0.3562821267007032;
    All information will be saved to a single .csv file for future use (e.g. data analysis in R!).
    
    Importantly, we do not know on which line this information appears, and we do not know how many digits long it is. We do know how the line is formatted, which informs our regular expression usage.


    For an extra challenge, we can parse each file to obtain **all** mutation rates, for example all of this information:
        global AC=0.3562821267007032;
        global AT=0.3561898444276437;
        global CG=0.266526902373061;
        global CT=1.502997839429121;
        global GT=0.2632076545083971;
    A script to perform this task is in parse_hyphy_output_extended.py .
