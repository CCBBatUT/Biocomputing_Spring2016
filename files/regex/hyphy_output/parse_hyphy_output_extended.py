    SJS
    Regular Expressions example script 2.
    
    All files name "rep..._nucfit.txt" in this directory are **real files from Stephanie's research**, produced by the software HyPhy (https://github.com/spond/hyphy). Each file, which is named according to the dataset it describes, contains information about a fitted model of sequence evolution.
    This script will parse all .txt files in the working directory to obtain all nucleotide mutation rates: the nucleotide mutation rate for "AC" (A to C or C to A), which appears in each file like this:
        global AC=0.3562821267007032;
        global AT=0.3561898444276437;
        global CG=0.266526902373061;
        global CT=1.502997839429121;
        global GT=0.2632076545083971;
    All information will be saved to a single .csv file for future use (e.g. data analysis in R!).
    
    This script uses re.findall to find all matching occurrences.
