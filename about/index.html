            <p>This is the official website for the Spring 2016 Peer-led Biocomputing Group at UT Austin, offered through the <a href="http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/">Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics</a>. The goal of this class is to take away any fear of programming that you may have so that computing can become an advantage rather than a barrier to your research. 
            <br><br><br>
            The class will meet on Wednesdays from 4-5 pm in FNT 1.104. In addition, feel free to join us for Open Coding Hour at Tuesdays 5-6pm in CCBB conference room (GDC 7.514) for any extra help or feedback.
